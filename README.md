# Welcome to ECE 373!

We'll be using Github classroom for homework throughout the term, so this is your chance to get farmiliar with 
how to access the classroom assignments, clone the repositories, and make commits!


# Finishing the Tutorial
Since you found this link in the Getting Started with Github Classroom tutorial, there are only a few steps left
to finish up.

  1. Clone this repo to your system
  2. Edit the Hello373.C program to include your name in the print statement
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("<YOUR NAME> says, Hello 373!!!");
   return 0;
}
```

  3. Commit your changes to the main branch of your repo!
  4. Push the changes, and check to make sure they show up.
